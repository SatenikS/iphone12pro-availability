# Scraper to check iPhone 12 Pro availability in Apple stores

In this project I have created a scraper to identify iPhone 12 Pro availability in Apple stores for a given zip code.

At the time of creating this notebook the earliest delivery date for the new iPhone 12 Pro is 3-4 weeks away. There are also no phones available for in-store pickup. Customer representatives recommend checking the Apple website regularly for occasional phone availability. Few hours after creating this scraper I received an email notifying me of one available phone with my desired color and capacity. One day later I was holding the phone in my hand!

For more details please see the [Notebook](https://github.com/SatenikS/iphone12pro-availability/blob/main/iPhone12-Pro.ipynb).
